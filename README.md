## This repository contains my projects that I have worked on as part of CS5250 course: Data Science Models, Processes, and Applications instructed by Prof. Welch in the spring of 2024 at Ohio University.

In this project, I create a model from scratch to apply K-means clustering on a real dataset. This dataset is not for public use. 

All codes are in main folder. Final project include graph analysis.
